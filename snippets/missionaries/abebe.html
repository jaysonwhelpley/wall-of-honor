        <h1 class="name">Abebe Abate</h1>
        <p class="meta">Ethiopia - January 16, 1998</p>
        <p>Abebe was so captivated by God’s love that he committed his life to bringing the gospel to those around him. </p>
        <p>He worked as the director for one of the Great Commission Ministry branch offices in Ethiopia. </p>
        <p>He desired to reach all around him with the good news of Christ. </p>
        <p>He and his wife even named their youngest child Wongel, which means “gospel.”</p>
        <p>One day Abebe left home to teach local church leaders how to do evangelistic outreach. Part of the training included showing the JESUS film. </p>
        <p>On his way, he was involved in a car accident that took his life. </p>
        <p>Though his death was devastating for his family and friends, Abebe knew all along what the gospel might cost him. </p>
        <p>But he also knew his eternity was secure with Christ. </p>
        <p>Before his death, Abebe said, “I should rather be a personal worker of the gospel in this short life of mine that is like a vapor.” </p>
        <p>Abebe believed Jesus is worth more than all the world has to offer.</p>
