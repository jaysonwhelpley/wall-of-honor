        <p class="meta">Bangladesh - April 24, 2003</p>
        <p>Hridoy, a young man who worked with Jesus Film Project<sup>®</sup>, helped show the JESUS film more than 400</p> times to thousands of people.
        <p>Even though local extremists threatened him, Hridoy boldly continued showing the film.</p>
        <p>Early one day in 2003, a group of assailants attacked him while he was unloading film equipment into</p> his house.
        <p>The attackers tied him to a bedpost and stabbed him to death.</p>
        <p>Several of them were eventually arrested, but many escaped—including the ringleader.</p>
        <p>Hridoy’s body was returned to his poor but God-fearing family.</p>
        <p>Even though he was one of their main providers, Hridoy’s family members were able to demonstrate grace by praying for the attackers and asking God to forgive their crimes and change their hearts.</p>
