        <h1 class="name">John Eluru and Moses Ogiel</h1>
        <p class="meta">Uganda - July 1987</p>
        <p>John and Moses were determined to make a way for Ugandans to hear the powerful story of Jesus.</p>
        <p> John voiced the role of Jesus in the Ateso version of the JESUS film.</p>
        <p> And two weeks after recording his lines, he set out with Moses and a group of co-workers to find more Ateso voice actors to finish the recording.</p>
        <p>While traveling, armed guerrilla fighters ambushed their vehicle and fired with automatic weapons.</p>
        <p>Moses was shot in the head and died at the scene.</p>
        <p>John, who was shot in the chest, died two days later.</p>
        <p>The ministry team in Uganda clung to John’s last words: “I am gone, but please let the project go on. This is the kind of thing Uganda needs. Never ever get scared; just carry on with the project.”</p>
        <p>So, the team completed the Ateso translation of the JESUS film.</p>
        <p>It premiered at a school where John had served as a teacher and as principal.</p>
        <p>As the students listened to the voice of their teacher speak the words of Jesus in Ateso, many decided to follow Christ.</p>
