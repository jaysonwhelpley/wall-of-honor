        <p class="meta">Peru - 1992</p>
        <p>Romulo and his family had faced persecution for generations. </p>
        <p>This did not deter him from wanting to share God’s truth and love with the people of Peru.</p>
        <p>Romulo was a pastor who also voiced the role of Jesus in the Ayacucho Quechua version of the JESUS film.</p>
        <p>He additionally worked to unify Peruvian churches by translating the Bible into Quechua languages.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the terrorists who had been persecuting his family captured Romulo and a group that was traveling with him.</p>
        <p>They killed Romulo, his brother, two of his nephews and some other pastors.</p>
        <p>There were 4,000 people in attendance at his funeral.</p>
        <p>Romulo’s family publicly forgave the terrorists in Jesus’ name, showing God-given grace toward the attackers who wronged them.</p>
        <p>At the time of Romulo’s death, most believers in his region of Peru credited their knowledge of Jesus Christ to his work.</p>
