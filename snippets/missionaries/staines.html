        <h1 class="name">Graham Staines, Philip Staines, Timothy Staines</h1>
        <p>Graham had a passion to share the powerful story of Jesus with the people of India. </p>
        <p>He and his family served as Jesus Film Project® partners and fellow missionaries in rural villages of Eastern India.</p>
        <p>One night in 1999, Graham and his two young sons, Philip and Timothy, slept in their car after meeting with Christian villagers.</p>
        <p>While they slept, more than 50 members of a local radical group attacked the car.</p>
        <p>The mob not only set fire to the vehicle, but they blocked Graham, Philip and Timothy from escaping.</p>
        <p>They even fought back villagers who tried to come to the rescue.</p>
        <p>Graham and his sons died wrapped in one another’s arms.</p>
        <p>After receiving the terrible news, Graham’s wife said, “I am terribly upset but not angry. My husband loved Jesus Christ, who has taught us to forgive our enemies.”</p>
        <p>She and her daughter continue to minister in India.</p>      </div>
