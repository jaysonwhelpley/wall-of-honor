        <h1 class="name">Necati Aydin</h1>
        <p class="meta">Turkey - April 18, 2007</p>
        <p>Though he was raised Muslim, Necati came to know the Lord and served as a pastor and as a Jesus Film Project<sup>®</sup> staff member in Turkey. </p>
        <p>On a crisp April morning, Necati left his house—where he lived with his wife and two young children—to attend a Bible study with his friends Tilmann and Ugur and a small group of youths. </p>
        <p>The youths had pretended to be interested in Jesus, but they were an armed group with bad intentions.</p>
        <p>Once the meeting started, they attacked Necati, Ugur and Tilmann.</p>
        <p>The attackers brutally tortured and eventually killed the three men.</p>
        <p>Their deaths shook the community.</p>
        <p>Necati’s funeral was a widely publicized event in his hometown.</p>
        <p>After the funeral, Necati’s and Tilmann’s wives publicly forgave the men who killed their husbands.</p>
        <p>They said they hoped the deaths of their husbands would not be in vain.</p>
        <p>Despite the horrific circumstances, the women were able to extend grace and forgiveness to the attackers because they themselves had experienced God’s grace and forgiveness through Christ.</p>
