        <p class="meta">Brazil - May 2, 2018</p>
        <p>Gilberto actively ministered to his people—the Yanomami—in the Brazilian rainforest. </p>
        <p>He was involved in Bible translation, attended conferences and pursued God’s will in his daily life and activities.</p>
        <p>He also served as one of the voices in the Yanomami translation of the JESUS film.</p>
        <p>Gilberto traveled from village to village with a Jesus Film Project® backpack, showing the JESUS film to anyone who would watch.</p>
        <p>His commitment to sharing Jesus earned him the nickname “Jesus Man.”</p>
        <p>One day in 2018, Gilberto visited a drug-addicted and demon-possessed relative to urge him to find freedom and salvation in Jesus.</p>
        <p>But a vengeance killing had been approved.</p>
        <p>When the relative saw Gilberto, he shot him in the face with a shotgun.</p>
        <p>Gilberto died instantly.</p>
        <p>In line with Yanomami tradition, all of Gilberto’s possessions were burned after his death, and the villagers vowed to never again mention his name.</p>
        <p>When other Yanomami Christians heard about this, they provided Gilberto’s widow and children with a large sum of money to care for them while they mourned the loss of Gilberto and their possessions.</p>
        <p>Yanomami Christians are comforted by the fact that Gilberto’s name will never be forgotten in heaven, even as it is forgotten in his village.</p>
        <p>Since Gilberto’s murder, people in villages that have been closed to the gospel are expressing interest in Jesus for the first time.</p>
